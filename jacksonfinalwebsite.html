    <h1>dragonsite </h1>
    <p> i am ai ice fire dargon hybrid. i live all over the pace. when people found me i made them forget about me.
      the game is a target blating game. when i got spotted i hid in an ice cave in a little known part of the world.
      i also met an ice pheonix and became friends with him. we hang out on saturdays and get lunch then go to swim.

"wait can yousay that again?" asked the skywing-icewing hybrid named crimson. "thre is a new skywing queen" said the nightwing named starflyer who was one of his friends. starflyer was named so because he had e xtra silver spots on his wings.  "i thaught there would be queen ruby." she was comfused. she thauht queen ruby was queen of the skywings."i thaught she only had a son" it was possible that someone unrelated had chalanged her for the throne but that was impossible. "realy?" she asked a little skeptical.  "atleast thats what queen glory said" she has heard of the rainwing who was one of the dragonets of destiny. the dragonets of destiny were  dragonets she has met before. it kind of reminded her of the winglets of jade acadamy. she had sighned up and hoped she would be abble to go,but she was a little woried that she wouldnt be able to.
she had also heard of the dragons who saved jade acadamy. it was a winglet thaxt she knew a few dragon in there inclouding turtle and moonwacher,both of wich she was also friends with.  she was friends with most of the others there. clay was one of her closest friends. she had met peril, wich she had gotehn along with well.2>
